Drag and Drop App from 'JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio' 

Coded along Jacinto who I thank for his great work on the course.

I added:
-new favicon
-one button that will change some styles on CSS (will probably replace it with a switch as in 'Light & Dark Mode' project from same course )
-two buttons on top witch will open a modal displaying random quotes and jokes (Modal content needs some new CSS)

Overall happy with the result but the project will take changes and some code cleaning.

I apreciate any feedback.
